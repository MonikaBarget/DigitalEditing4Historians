# What is a "text" (in a historical perspective)?

Our digital age is also to a large extent a textual age as we are surrounded by messenger services, social media, news feeds and websites that do not only require as to process images but also written language. So is a text merely the counterpart of an image? Or can the two overlap? How do different academic disciplines define texts?

In fact, colloquial perceptions of "text" may not always conform with scientific approaches, so here are a few (conflicting) definitions for discussions:

[Wikipedia article on "text" in literary theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory):

> In literary theory, a text is any object that can be "read", whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message. This set of signs is considered in terms of the informative message's content, rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented. 

[Troxel, Ronald L. “What Is the 'Text' in Textual Criticism?” Vetus Testamentum, vol. 66, no. 4, 2016, pp. 603–626. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/44647543):

> Textual criticism has long used terms and phrases incorporating 'text' without scrutinizing whether they are defensible. Contributing to this problem has been imprecision in the definition of 'text' itself. Contemporary scholarship has nibbled at the edges of a definition, but no focused consideration has been given to pinpointing what it is textual criticism criticizes. This essay examines the concepts underlying talk of 'text', positing that 'text' must be defined within a matrix with author and reader. A text's production and preservation reflects its reading communities' conferral upon it of the status of 'text'. Although establishment of the earliest recoverable form(s) of a text remains important, that must be paired with understanding a text's role in shaping and reflecting the lives of its reading communities. Careful definition of 'text' and the nomenclature that describes it can bring clarity to conceiving the task of textual criticism.

[Mowitt, John. “What Is a Text Today?” PMLA, vol. 117, no. 5, 2002, pp. 1217–1221. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/823172):

> As Derrida observes, the pressing question here is about the difference between interpreting the world and changing it. Because the second text, the test as pardigm, seeks precisely to frame this difference and designate as the remainder, the trace, that which falls out of the immanent unfolding of empire's limits, it continues to matter today.

[Lerer, Seth, and Joseph A. Dane. “Introduction: What Is a Text?” Huntington Library Quarterly, vol. 58, no. 1, 1995, pp. 1–10. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/3817894):

> Nonetheless, although "textuality" has become something of a term to conjure with -- and disciplines as diverse as film studies, cultural antrhopology, and the history of scinece imagine themselves working with the meaning and the mode of "texts" -- the processes of transcribing, collating, descrining, and editing books and manuscripts of earlier historical periods remain, for the most part, relatively familiar. (...) The question still evades us: What is a text? Or, to ask it more precisely, what are the relationships between the methods of textual study and the privileging of a class of objects called texts? How does an artifact become a text? Does it become one only when subjected to the inquiries of textual analysis? For that matter, can a text lose its status and revert to the merely artifactual?

# Elements of scholarly editing

e.g. [Hitler, mein Kampf - eine kritische Edition](https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/aktuelles/themen/edition-mein-kampf/)

>Ziel der Edition ist es daher, „Mein Kampf“ als bedeutende zeithistorische Quelle zu erschließen, den Entstehungskontext von Hitlers Weltanschauung nachzuzeichnen, seine gedanklichen Vorläufer offenzulegen und seine Ideen und Behauptungen mit den Ergebnissen der modernen Forschung zu kontrastieren.

> Die Historikerinnen und Historiker des Instituts für Zeitgeschichte haben den Originaltext Stück für Stück auseinandergenommen und ihn mit mehr als 3.500 Anmerkungen versehen. Diese wissenschaftlichen Kommentare erfüllen eine Vielzahl verschiedenster Aufgaben:

    Hintergrundinformationen zu den dargestellten Personen und Ereignissen
    Erläuterung zentraler ideologischer Begriffe
    Offenlegung von Hitlers Quellen
    Erklärung der ideengeschichtlichen Wurzeln
    Zeitgenössische Kontextualisierung
    Korrektur von Fehlern und einseitigen Darstellungen
    Ausblick auf die Folgen von Hitlers Schrift
    Neue Beiträge zur Grundlagenforschung


# Examples of digital scholarly editions

[EADH catalogue of digital editions](https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/)

> Since 2012 the Catalogue of Digital Editions has been gathering digital editions and texts in an attempt to survey and identify best practice in the field of digital scholarly editing. Analogous initiatives exist but don't provide the granular analysis of features necessary to better understand the rationale and methodology behind the creation of a digital edition. This Catalogue provides an accessible record of standards and building technologies used, and thus an insight into past and present projects.

The catalogue can be filtered by period. One example of an early modern edition is [In Mozart's Words - an annotated version of the voluminous correspondence of Mozart and his family](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/mozartwords/) created by Stiftung Mozarteum Salzburg, the University of Sheffield and King's College London.

# Introduction to markup as a way to structure and interpret text

In order to be able to create links between words and different texts, sort them by date, identify authors and provide additional context, certain sections of each text in need to be highlighted and enriched with meta-information. This process is called text encoding, and the standard procedures used to encode text are markup languages. The most commonly used markup for digital text-based editions in the humanities is XML.

# Writing and editing XML with XML editors

Although XML can be written with any standard plain text editor, special XML editors foster correct syntax and include special features for the parsing and analysis of XML files.

[OXYGEN](https://www.oxygenxml.com/), a very popular and elaborate XML used for many scholarly editions worldwide, requires a paid licence while other editors are open source.
