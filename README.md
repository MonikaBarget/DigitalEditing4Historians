# DigitalEditing4Historians

This repository contains data samples and teaching material for digital scholarly editing. Special emphasis is placed on the challenges of historical sources and the needs of historians who wish to create editions as tools of text comparison and source criticism.

The examples presented here are, for the most part, taken from the ["Letters 1916-1923"](http://letters1916.maynoothuniversity.ie/) project, digital editions created at the IEG Mainz (Germany) and student projects. 

These projects are credited and linked throughout the files.
