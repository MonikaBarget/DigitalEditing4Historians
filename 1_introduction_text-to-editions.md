# What is a "text" (in a historical perspective)?

Our digital age is also to a large extent a textual age as we are surrounded by messenger services, social media, news feeds and websites that do not only require as to process images but also written language. So is a text merely the counterpart of an image? Or can the two overlap? How do different academic disciplines define texts?

In fact, colloquial perceptions of "text" may not always conform with scientific approaches, so here are a few (conflicting) definitions for discussions:

[Titon, Jeff Todd. “Text.” The Journal of American Folklore, vol. 108, no. 430, 1995, pp. 432–448. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/541655):

> In its older and still most common sense *text* means written words, usually words given some kind of authority. Editors preparing literary editions or historical documents seek a text "most nearly representing the author's original work" (Oxford English Dictionary). For literary scholars a text is a work of literature; for historians, a text is a historical document; for musicologists, a text is the words to a piece of music.

[Lerer, Seth, and Joseph A. Dane. “Introduction: What Is a Text?” Huntington Library Quarterly, vol. 58, no. 1, 1995, pp. 1–10. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/3817894):

> Nonetheless, although "textuality" has become something of a term to conjure with -- and disciplines as diverse as film studies, cultural antrhopology, and the history of scinece imagine themselves working with the meaning and the mode of "texts" -- the processes of transcribing, collating, descrining, and editing books and manuscripts of earlier historical periods remain, for the most part, relatively familiar. (...) The question still evades us: What is a text? Or, to ask it more precisely, what are the relationships between the methods of textual study and the privileging of a class of objects called texts? How does an artifact become a text? Does it become one only when subjected to the inquiries of textual analysis? For that matter, can a text lose its status and revert to the merely artifactual?

[Wikipedia article on "text" in literary theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_(literary_theory):

> In literary theory, a text is any object that can be "read", whether this object is a work of literature, a street sign, an arrangement of buildings on a city block, or styles of clothing. It is a coherent set of signs that transmits some kind of informative message. This set of signs is considered in terms of the informative message's content, rather than in terms of its physical form or the medium in which it is represented. 

[Troxel, Ronald L. “What Is the 'Text' in Textual Criticism?” Vetus Testamentum, vol. 66, no. 4, 2016, pp. 603–626. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/44647543):

> Textual criticism has long used terms and phrases incorporating 'text' without scrutinizing whether they are defensible. Contributing to this problem has been imprecision in the definition of 'text' itself. Contemporary scholarship has nibbled at the edges of a definition, but no focused consideration has been given to pinpointing what it is textual criticism criticizes. This essay examines the concepts underlying talk of 'text', positing that 'text' must be defined within a matrix with author and reader. A text's production and preservation reflects its reading communities' conferral upon it of the status of 'text'. Although establishment of the earliest recoverable form(s) of a text remains important, that must be paired with understanding a text's role in shaping and reflecting the lives of its reading communities. Careful definition of 'text' and the nomenclature that describes it can bring clarity to conceiving the task of textual criticism.

[Mowitt, John. “What Is a Text Today?” PMLA, vol. 117, no. 5, 2002, pp. 1217–1221. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/823172):

> As Derrida observes, the pressing question here is about the difference between interpreting the world and changing it. Because the second text, the test as pardigm, seeks precisely to frame this difference and designate as the remainder, the trace, that which falls out of the immanent unfolding of empire's limits, it continues to matter today.

# What informational layers does a text contain, and how "objective" are they?

* "meaning" in text?

[Crosman, Robert. “Do Readers Make Meaning?” The Reader in the Text: Essays on Audience and Interpretation, edited by Susan R. Suleiman and Inge Crosman, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, 1980, pp. 149–164. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zv3jc.10):

> The question is itself annoyingly vague and ambiguous, yet it is as close as I can get to expressing what seems to me the central issue of literary theory today. (...) If we cannot immediately answer it, the problem lies chiefly, I think, in the word *meaning*, which has several conflicting senses.

[“Meaning and Text.” Verbal Art: A Philosophy of Literature and Literary Experience, by ANDERS PETTERSSON, McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000, pp. 83–102. JSTOR] (www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt80dpm.9):

> The concepts “text,” “interpretation,” and “meaning” played no important part in the previous discussion. In fact, I refrain from assigning a structural role to these concepts in my theory. I regard them as wide, all-embracing terms of only indirect interest in an analysis striving for clarity and precision. Concepts like “text,” “meaning,” and “interpretation” are bound to appear to be of central importance to those who think in terms of a folk theory of communication, that is in terms of the transportation and container metaphors.

* genre?

[Rowlett, John L., editor. “History and Genre.” Genre Theory and Historical Change: Theoretical Essays of Ralph Cohen, University of Virginia Press, Charlottesville; London, 2017, pp. 85–104. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1v2xtv6.10):

> In recognition of this multiplicity of definitions, I wish to argue that genre concepts in theory and practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons. And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category. Genres are open categories.

* layout / form?

[Van Leeuwen, Theo, et al. “Critical Layout Analysis.” Internationale Schulbuchforschung, vol. 17, no. 1, 1995, pp. 25–43. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/43056999):

> All texts are multimodal. Language always comes in the company of other semiotic modes. When we speak we articulate our message not just with words, but through a complex interplay of speech, facial expression, gesture and posture. When we write our message is not only expressed linguistically, but also through a visual arrangement of marks on a page. Any form of text analysis which ignores this will not be able to account for all the meanings expressed in texts. Nevertheless, there has long been a trend towards the monomodal, especially in the most "serious", the most highly valued kinds of speech and writing. (...) This trend is now being reversed. Increasingly the written text is no longer structured by linguistic means, through verbal connectors and verbal cohesive devices, but visually, through layout, through the spatial arrangement of blocks of text, pictures and other graphic elements on the page. The wordprocessor has accelerated this trend.

> Das Layout dient nicht nur dazu, Texte attraktiver zu gestalten, es leistet auch einen wichtigen Beitrag zu der Struktur und der Bedeutung von multimodalen Texten, die sprachliche und visuelle Kommunikation kombinieren. Es arbeitet gleichzeitig auf drei Ebenen. Die Layout-Elemente (Textblöcke, Bilder und andere graphische Elemente) sind durch ihre Seitenpositionierung miteinander verbunden (links-rechts, oben-unten und Mitte-Rand), was ihnen einen spezifischen informativen Wert wie „gegeben" und „neu", „ideell" und „real", „zentral" und „marginal" verleiht. Die Elemente stechen unterschiedlich hervor und verbinden sich oder heben sich voneinander auf verschiedene Weise ab. 

* materiality?

[Bawarshi, Anis. “MATERIALITY.” Keywords in Writing Studies, edited by PAUL HEILKER and PETER VANDENBERG, University Press of Colorado, 2015, pp. 108–113. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt130hkrq):

> The term *materiality* has a wide range of meanings within the discourses of writing studies, often functioning as a modifier (“materialist”) to other abstractions (as in, “materialist views of situation”). As reflected in its various significations within the field, materiality is used not only to account for the presence of matter and the material, but also to describe the operations of matter (“materialism”). As such, materiality is deployed both as a thing itself (an embodied presence), and as a thing that can act in the service of its own ends (as having agency).

**All of this is part of academic discussions on the "value" of a specific source (German: "Quellenwert"). Such discussions especially arise when sources are potentially volatile and / or fragile. This includes all kinds of hand-written notes and ephemera that emerge as "side-products" of cultural activities: e.g. [Ulrich, Paul S. “THEATERZETTEL UND THEATERALMANACHE – QUELLENKRITISCHE ANMERKUNGEN.” Theater - Zettel - Sammlungen: Erschließung, Digitalisierung, Forschung, edited by Matthias J. Pernerstorfer, vol. 1, Hollitzer Verlag, Wien, 2012, pp. 3–26. JSTOR](www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6jmb66.4)**

# Markup as a way to structure and interpret text

In order to be able to create links between words and different texts, sort them by date, identify authors and provide additional context, certain sections of each text in need to be highlighted and enriched with meta-information. This process is called text encoding, and the standard procedures used to encode text are markup languages. The most commonly used markup for digital text-based editions in the humanities is XML.

# Writing and editing XML with XML editors

Although XML can be written with any standard plain text editor, special XML editors foster correct syntax and include special features for the parsing and analysis of XML files.

[OXYGEN](https://www.oxygenxml.com/), a very popular and elaborate XML used for many scholarly editions worldwide, requires a paid licence while other editors are open source.

![Oxygen interface](https://www.oxygenxml.com/img/tei_editor_big.jpg)

WIKIPEDIA provides a handy [overview of XML editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_XML_editors), detailing their functionality and their compatibility with different operating systems.

# Overall purpose of XML schemas

XML schemas are a way to define XML elements specifally for one edition project or a series of related projects, e.g. editions of historical letters. Parsing XML files against the project schema ensures that the syntax and hierarchies of the files are correct and that the files will eventually display correctly on the web or in print.

# Challenges of XML schemas for historical sources

However, defining a schema also comes with many pitfalls, one of them being the premature limitation of options to describe certain textual features. The challenge especially affects editions of historical sources as pre-modern texts often use inconsistent spelling, quotes from foreign languages such as Greek and Latin, or may contain many sections that are no longer legible.

Developing a model schema for editions of historical letters has been one joint project in the Digital Humanities, addressed by researchers of different disciplinary backgrounds and from different countries. [ARTICLE]

# Scholarly editions between description and interpretation

Also mention the problem of multimodality in editing... e.g. the inclusion of different source types into one edition! 

Editions are "texts in contexts"?!

Editions foster normalisation, linking, structure and abstraction!

# Established elements of scholarly editing

e.g. [Hitler, mein Kampf - eine kritische Edition](https://www.ifz-muenchen.de/aktuelles/themen/edition-mein-kampf/)

> Ziel der Edition ist es daher, „Mein Kampf“ als bedeutende zeithistorische Quelle zu erschließen, den Entstehungskontext von Hitlers Weltanschauung nachzuzeichnen, seine gedanklichen Vorläufer offenzulegen und seine Ideen und Behauptungen mit den Ergebnissen der modernen Forschung zu kontrastieren.

> Die Historikerinnen und Historiker des Instituts für Zeitgeschichte haben den Originaltext Stück für Stück auseinandergenommen und ihn mit mehr als 3.500 Anmerkungen versehen. Diese wissenschaftlichen Kommentare erfüllen eine Vielzahl verschiedenster Aufgaben:

    Hintergrundinformationen zu den dargestellten Personen und Ereignissen
    Erläuterung zentraler ideologischer Begriffe
    Offenlegung von Hitlers Quellen
    Erklärung der ideengeschichtlichen Wurzeln
    Zeitgenössische Kontextualisierung
    Korrektur von Fehlern und einseitigen Darstellungen
    Ausblick auf die Folgen von Hitlers Schrift
    Neue Beiträge zur Grundlagenforschung
    
# Chances and challenges of digitisation

> Fragen der Verwaltung und Bereitstellung von digitalen Ressourcen kommt heute in Museen, Archiven und Bibliotheken, aber auch in der geisteswissenschaftlichen Forschung zunehmende Bedeutung zu. Vielerorts hat man mit der Digitalisierung von Beständen begonnen und versucht so zur Erhaltung und bestandsschonenden Zugänglichmachung von Büchern, Handschriften und anderen kulturellen Artefakten beizutragen. Die heute verfügbaren Speichermedien setzen dabei Massendigitalisierungsprojekten keine wirklichen physikalischen Grenzen, vielmehr sind es Fragen der Logistik und Nachhaltigkeit, die sich in solchen Projekten in vielfacher Weise stellen. 

# Examples of digital scholarly editions

[EADH catalogue of digital editions](https://dig-ed-cat.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/)

> Since 2012 the Catalogue of Digital Editions has been gathering digital editions and texts in an attempt to survey and identify best practice in the field of digital scholarly editing. Analogous initiatives exist but don't provide the granular analysis of features necessary to better understand the rationale and methodology behind the creation of a digital edition. This Catalogue provides an accessible record of standards and building technologies used, and thus an insight into past and present projects.

The catalogue can be filtered by period. One example of an early modern edition is [In Mozart's Words - an annotated version of the voluminous correspondence of Mozart and his family](https://www.dhi.ac.uk/mozartwords/) created by Stiftung Mozarteum Salzburg, the University of Sheffield and King's College London.
