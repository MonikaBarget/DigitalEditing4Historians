# Case Study: Annotation choices in the "Littlehales" project

The project "Inside Dublin Castle - the correspondence of Edward Baker Littlehales, 1808" is a small digital edition prepared by MA students of Digitial Humanities at the Centre for Digital Humanities in Maynooth, Ireland, in the winter term of 2017/2018. The edition consists in letters exchanged between Edward Baker Littlehales, a British government official working at Dublin Castle, and two of his colleagues in the summer of 1808, covering rural uprisings in Ireland and other political issues of the day.

Although the project focussed on a limited amount of letters from a much larger collection held at the Maynooth University Library, deciding how to annotate those sources wasn't easy. Some of the letters were several pages long and contained many names of places and people as well as technical terms relating to early 19th-century government policy in Ireland. In most cases, we did not know at first who the people mentioned were and had to create a "dramatis personae" to identify those that were most important. As for place names, it was often difficult to handle inconsistent or old-fashioned spelling. And the students had to learn more about the overall context of the Irish Act of Union and the British rule in Ireland to contextualise the events mentioned in the letters.

The following video gives you an idea of how the project progressed and what challenges the team met:

The final list of annotations that the team created is [ADD LINK TO TABLE].

The annotations highlight the political nature of Edward B. Littlehales's correspondence and shed light on the challenges met by the Anglo-Irish administration in the years immediately following the dissolution of the Irish Parliament. Ireland's (postal) infrastructure, trade, the press or Littlehales's personal relations were, for the purpose of creating a consistent edition with a "unique selling point", not covered in our edition. At some point, someone interested in the family connections between members of the Anglo-Irish upper class might create a very different edition of the Littlehales letters, perhaps linking them with material from other archives. Annotations are always a matter of choice, closely linked with research questions pursued by the editors. It is important to make these choices transparent in the introduction to the edition and in all scholarly publications resulting from it.

# Task:

Imagine that you have been asked to create a digital edition of the texts that were printed in the course of the mid-19th-century "Jesuit controversy" in Mainz.
The cause of the controvery was that the Jesuits had been given charge of the parish church St. Christoph's ("Christophskirche"), which is now a World War II ruin and memorial in the inner-city. Many citizens of Mainz were suspicious of the Jesuit order and filed complaints. The city council's grievances were, for instance, discussed by the Catholic Bishop Mainz, [Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler](https://www.regionalgeschichte.net/bibliothek/biographien/ketteler-wilhelm-emmanuel-von.html).

Read Ketteler's address [Die Jesuiten in Mainz und die Beschwerde des Gemeinderathes bei den hohen Ständen gegen deren Aufenthalt in der Pfarrwohnung zu St. Christoph : Ansprache an seine Diöcesanen](https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de//de/fs1/object/display/bsb10568409_00005.html) of 1864 and try to find out who the major agents in the controversy were. What places, actions, political regulations or theological concepts are mentioned more than once? Which of those would you annotate in a digital edition of similar texts?

Put the most important words you would annotate in a table and try to think of the XML tags you would use to mark them up. Write a few sentences to explain your decision. We will be delighted to feature your contributions on our [IEG DH Lab blog](https://dhlab.hypotheses.org/).
